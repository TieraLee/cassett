Class Exercise #5

Describe any challenges you faced as well as any extra polish you applied (for the extra points):
I initially had an issue determining how keep track of the position in the music, so for it will start
in the right spot for various playback modes. After reading the documenation, I realized that the SamplePlayer
object automatically saves the current spot. I also had a problem with getting the music to play after the button
click sound, not during or before. When the music plays during or before the button click, it sounded unnatural and
did not make a lot of sense.  It took some fooling around with an event handler to tell the program "after the button clicks
then stop/play the music."
